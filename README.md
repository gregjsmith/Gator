#Gator

Small minded db migration tool.


Few things: 

- Gator is for windows
- Gator manages migrations and database versions
- Gator is written in c#, but otherwise has nothing to do with c#, .NET or Visual Studio, it's just a command line interface
- Gator does not write or generate sql. If you'd like to write c# (or whatever) code and have it be translated into sql for you, please don't use this tool, it will not help you
